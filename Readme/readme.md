## 🎮 Game Description

The **Snake Game** is a classic browser-based arcade game developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer and earn points.

The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or with its own body.  
The objective is to score as high as possible.
